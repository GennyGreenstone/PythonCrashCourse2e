### 3-1. Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print each person's name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time

names = ['joe', 'alex', 'rob', 'kitty', 'heather']

print(names[0].title())
print(names[1].title())
print(names[2].title())
print(names[3].title())
print(names[-1].title())

### Clearly I had a little fun with this assignment formatting the names with .title() and Heather's using -1 to return the last name in the list
