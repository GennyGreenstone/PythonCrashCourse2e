# 3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a morocycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as "I would like to own a Honda Motorcycle."

#Transportation sounds dumb as heck to me so I'm gonna do animals I like instead

pets = ['dogs', 'cats', 'pigs', 'goats']

love = f"One day I will care for "

meow = f"My {pets[1]} will protect me from demons"

oink = f"{pets[2].title()} will always be my favorite animal "

awe = f"My {pets[0]} and {pets[3]} will be best friends"
print(love + pets[0])
print(meow)
